# Decentralized-Federated-learning-for-IoMT-Anomaly-Detection
Decentralized federated learning trains AI models on distributed IoT devices, enabling privacy-preserving, collaborative anomaly detection in IoT networks without centralized data collection, improving security and scalability.
 A decentralized node architecture with secure peer-to-peer communication, a Quantum-inspired Deep Neural Network (QDNN) for effective classification of high-dimensional data, and a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) for robust feature extraction and anomaly detection are all part of our framework.
