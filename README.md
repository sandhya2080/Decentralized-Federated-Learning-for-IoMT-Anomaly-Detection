# Decentralized-Federated-Learning-for-IoMT-Anomaly-Detection
propose a federated learning framework that is designed specifically for IoMT environments and is both secure and scalable. A decentralized node architecture with secure peer-to-peer communication, a Quantum-inspired Deep Neural Network (QDNN) for effective classification of high-dimensional data, and a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) for robust feature extraction and anomaly detection are all part of our framework.
We proposed a privacy-aware framework that  protect our  IoMT systems and devices from  cyber attacks. It helps to protects the privacy of sensitive data at multi-levels, and filter module,consisting of a data distribution differential privacy with attack detection modules and data fusion.
